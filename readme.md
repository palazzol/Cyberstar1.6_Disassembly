# Cyberstar 1.6 EPROM image disassembly/reassembly - WIP

The Cyberamic Control Center was the original animatronic control computer designed for Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre in the late 70's

The first generation machine utilized a 6502 processor, and was used from around 1978-1984.

The second generation machine upgraded the CPU to a 68HC11F1 processor, and was used from roughly 1985-1994.

This is the disassembly of the ROM image from a 2nd generation machine.
